# Datasets

This module provides benchmark datasets for graph-level and node-level prediction. 
Datasets are automatically downloaded and saved locally on first usage. 
You can configure the path where the data are stored by creating a `~/.spektral/config.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "dataset_folder": "/path/to/dataset/folder"
}
```
